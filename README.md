In this project, the objective is to build a machine learning model for classifying iris flowers based on their distinctive features using Python, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. The project will commence with the collection and preprocessing of a dataset containing iris flower samples, including features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Scikit-learn will be employed for data preprocessing, splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, and initial model development, likely using popular classifiers like Support Vector Machines or Random Forests. Subsequently, TensorFlow, a powerful machine learning framework, will be used to enhance the model's capabilities, potentially incorporating neural networks for improved classification accuracy. The project aims to deliver a robust and accurate machine learning model capable of classifying iris flowers based on their features, providing valuable insights into the potential applications of such models in botanical research or horticulture.
